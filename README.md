Exploring Tailwind CSS 


üß† What is Tailwind CSS?

        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. That means:
        
        It gives you low-level, atomic utility classes for common CSS properties like margin, padding, color, font size, etc.
        
        You don't write custom CSS rules‚Äîyou compose your UI directly in HTML using these utility classes.
        
        This is different from other frameworks like Bootstrap, which give you pre-made components. With Tailwind, you design everything from scratch using utilities.
        

üé® Why Use Tailwind?

‚úÖ Pros:

        Fast to build and iterate UI
        Great for responsive and custom designs
        
        Easy to maintain (you see styles in HTML)
        
        Works well with modern tools (React, Vue, Next.js)

        
‚ùå Cons:

        HTML can get long (many classes)
        
        Takes time to learn the naming system
        

üßæ Example: Compare with CSS

Traditional CSS:

        <style>
          .btn {
            background-color: #3b82f6;
            color: white;
            padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
            border-radius: 0.25rem;
          }
        </style>
        <button class="btn">Click Me</button>
        

Tailwind CSS:

        <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Click Me</button>
        
        
üîç See the difference?

         You don‚Äôt need to define styles separately. The classes are the styles.
